# Introduction

## Code

To replicate the results:

1. Download the github repo 
2. Open Rstudio (or R) and run
`install.packages(c("tictoc","cowplot","xtable","parallel","expm","foreach","gamlr","glmnet","ggplot2","dplyr","plyr","reshape2","tidyr","iterators","assertthat","tidyverse","rmutil"))`

### Figure : Own price elasticities for categories as estimated by Orthogonal Least Squares (Double Machine Learning)
3. Open /orthoml-master/src/Figure3.R and set directoryname to the location of downloaded file. From the shell/or in R, run `Figure3.R`. 

The code produces the estimate and 95% confidence interval for the average price elasticity for each category in {Drinks, Dairy, NonEdible, Snacks}. A plot example for Drinks is given below

### Figure : Own price elasticities by the months of a calendar year as estimated by  Orthogonal Least Squares (Double Machine Learning)

4. Open /orthoml-master/src/Figure3.R and set directoryname to the location of downloaded file. From the shell/or in R, `Figure4.R`. 

The code produces the estimate and 95% confidence interval for the average price elasticity by calendar month for each category in {Dairy, NonEdible, Snacks, Sodas, Water}. A plot example is given below


### Figure : Distribution of Own price elasticities as estimated by Orthogonal Lasso, Double Orthogonal Ridge, and Orthogonal Least Squares 

4. Open /orthoml-master/src/Figure3.R and to the location of downloaded file. From the shell/or in R, `Figure5.R`. 

The code produces a histogram of estimates for the average price elasticity for categories, aggregated at Level2, Level 3, Level4, grouped by color at Level1. A plot example is given below

We see that Lasso estimates are most concenrated (shrinked towards homogenous specification), Orthogonal Least Squares  is most dispersed (and least precise), and  Double Orthogonal Ridge is in the middle.
